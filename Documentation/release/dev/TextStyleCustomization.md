## TextStyleCustomization

The text source has been updated and now lets you customize
the borders and the background of the text. For the borders,
it is now possible to draw round corners, choose the color as
well as the thickness. A combo box allows you to define the visibility
of the border (only on hover, always or never).
For the text, you can now choose the background color and opacity
and the right and top padding between the border and the text.
